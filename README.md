The proposed IoT-based crop recommendation system aims to provide farmers with intelligent crop suggestions by leveraging real-time environmental and soil data. A network of IoT sensors is deployed in the agricultural field to monitor real-time parameters, including soil humidity, temperature, pH and NPK levels in soil. A machine learning model is developed to recommend suitable crops. A user-friendly mobile or web application is designed to provide farmers with real-time sensor data visualizations and Crop recommendations based on current field conditions. Web application also includes weather API which is responsible for displaying the climatic conditions in various regions.
